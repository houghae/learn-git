# Learn about git and github

## Also learn markdown

## Headers are made with the hash symbol. Remember to leave a blank line before and after the heading.

#### 1 thru 6 hashes can be used.

**Bold is double asterisk on each side of the phrase**

*Italic is a single asterisk*

Bold and italic is ***triple asterisk***

> A blockquote is just a greater than symbol
>
> Multiple parapgraphs are just > on a blank line
>> And nested blockquotes are n number of > symbols

### Ordered Lists

1. Basically, WYSIWYG
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented second item

### Unordered lists

- First item (type dashes, get bullets)
- Second item
    - 2.1 item
    - 2.2 item
- Third item

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When theyâ€™re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.

1. Open the file.
2. Find the following code block on line 21:

        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Test</title>
          </head>

3. Update the title to match the name of your website.

# Code

To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

At the command prompt, type `nano`.

Escape `single ticks` with `` `double ticks` ``. Backticks are **NOT** single quotes!
``Or just put the `whole thing` in double ticks.``

#### Code blocks are made by indenting everything 1 tab (4 spaces).

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>

### Horizontal rule

Just like headers, put a blank line before and after.
Use 3 dashes on a line by itself.

## Links are important

Put link texts in brackets, and follow immediately with URL in parentheses.

[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) has been great, but [Pop OS](https://pop.system76.com/) is a little cleaner *IMO*

### URLs and emails

Just add angle brackets

<hi@email.com>

<https://www.youtube.com>

### Images

To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL.

You can add a link to the image by enclosing the whole MD in brackets and then ading the link in parentheses.

# Escaping Characters

Add a backslash in front of said character.

* Do you want a bullet

\* Or not. Pay attention to the slash direction.
